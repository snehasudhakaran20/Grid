Algo : 
Convert RGB to CIE-LAB
1. normalize r,g,b, ie /255
2. inverse gamma correction R`= F(R) ,  eq given
3. multiple with the transformation matrix [XYZ] = [T][RGB] - standard values - need to see how they were derived
4. Normalize XYZ with white values uding D65 luminant - ?
5. Apply CIE lab transformation function fxyz
6. Final step phew : calc L,A,B from the above results of fxyz

L : luminant 0 - 100, dark to white
a : green to magenta axis
b : blue to yellow axis

Built in functions for all of above : skimage, colorspacious
